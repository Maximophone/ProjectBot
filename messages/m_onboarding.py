- write an introduction if they have not
- join the next onboarding meeting
- point them to a "new joiner guide" (does not exist yet)

After this meeting, the newcomer should spend some time thinking about which team or project they want to contribute to.
It is important to organise a check-in meeting with them the next week. This will be the final step of this onboarding.

During the check-in meeting, the goal is to:
- make sure that everything is going smoothly for them, answer any remaining questions that they have
- get them to sign the [volunteer form](https://airtable.com/appWPTGqZmUcs3NWu/pag7ztLh27Omj5s2n/form)
- get the output of their reflection, and have them officially joining a team or project
